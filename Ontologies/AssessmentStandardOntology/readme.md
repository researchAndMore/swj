# Assessment Standard Ontology

## Overview

This repository contains the formal implementation of the ontology developed using the Simplified Agile Methodology for Ontology Development (SAMOD). While the complete ontological framework consists of both the TBox and ABox, we are currently only able to publish the TBox component.

## Available Resources

- [TBox.ttl](./TBox.ttl) - The terminological component of our ontology in Turtle format, containing all class definitions, property specifications, and axioms that define the concepts.

## ABox

Due to the current state of our research, we are unable to publish the ABox component openly at this time. Interested researchers may contact the authors to discuss access to this component.
